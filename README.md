# Interpretable-Models-Regularization

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This assignment focuses on two key areas in machine learning:

Decision Trees as Interpretable Models

Building and pruning interpretable decision trees for the Acute Inflammations dataset.

Extracting human-readable IFâ€“THEN rules.

LASSO and Boosting for Regression

Applying linear models, regularization (ridge, lasso), PCA regression, and boosting methods to the Communities and Crime dataset.

Evaluating model performance and feature selection under different regularization strategies.
